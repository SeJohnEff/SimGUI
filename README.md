# SimGUI

Lightweight GUI wrapper for CLI tools. This project is independent from
https://github.com/SeJohnEff/sysmo-usim-tool and does not modify it — point
SimGUI at any CLI script to run it in a desktop GUI.

Quickstart
----------

Create a virtualenv and install dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
